> **NOTE:** In Hawaii, we use have the Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA) which provides for open access to government records. So, UIPA corresponds to FOIA (Freedom of Information Act). See the [Office of Information Practices (OIP)](https://oip.hawaii.gov/) website for more information.

> Also, the [Froide](https://github.com/okfde/froide) Freedom of Information Portal software that the UIPA.org website is based on uses the term *public body* while UIPA and OIP use the terms *public agency*, *government agency*, and *county agency*.
