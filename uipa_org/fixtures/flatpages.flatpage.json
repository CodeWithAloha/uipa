But we discourage account deletion because you will\nno longer have the ability to classify or update the requests made with that account. When an\naccount is deleted, we remove your email address from our system, you will no longer receive\nupdates regarding your requests, and you will not be able to login. Even if you create a new\nlogin with the same email address, the account will not be linked to your earlier requests.</p>\n<p>Although account deletion erases a user's email address, we keep a deleted user's name to\nbetter protect privacy through the system's automated redactions of incoming email messages.\nIf you wish to have your name deleted from the system, you can <a\nhref=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org?subject=UIPA.org:%20Delete%20User%20Name\">email us</a>,\nbut please be aware that removing your name from the system will disable features intended to\nprotect user privacy for incoming email messages that are posted on the site.</p>\n\n</li>\n<h3>Publishing Requests and Records Received</h3>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"4\"></a>Can the site embargo requests?\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, we recognize that reporters and others may have an interest in not immediately disclosing\na request and any documents received in response to that request. You control whether a\nrequest and any government response is released publicly for up to 1 year after the request.\nWhen making the request, uncheck the box stating “This request is public.” <b>If you do not\nuncheck the box when making the request, your request will be publicly disclosed on the\nInternet as soon as it is made.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt any time after the request, you can publish it and any response. When you are ready to do\nso, the summary page for your request will note at the top that the request is not public and\nprovide you the option to \"Make this request public now\".\n</p>\n<p>\nOne year after the request, it and any response will be released regardless whether you initially\nmarked it as private. You will receive an email two weeks before the materials are released\npublicly.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"5\"></a>Who has access to my non-public requests?</p>\n<p>\nThe site administrator would have access for maintenance purposes. The site administrator will\nnot share your non-public requests with others. But all requests will be publicly disclosed 1 year\nafter you make the request.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"6\"></a>Can I share my non-public request with others?</p>\n<p> Yes, the summary page for your request identifies a \"Secret Short URL\" that can be\nshared with someone that you want to have access to the request before it is disclosed publicly.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"7\"></a>Why must requests become public after 1 year?\n</p>\n<p>\nThe process for obtaining public records can be difficult. But it is made\nmore difficult by the fact that individual members of the public cannot\nbuild on the experiences of others going through the same struggle. By\nsharing records and agency responses, the public benefits from the\ncollective experiences of other requesters.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso your request for public records is not confidential. Requests for public records\nthemselves are government records subject to disclosure under the UIPA. <a\n\nhref=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/1993/11/93-23.pdf\">OIP Op. 93-23</a> at 5.\nAnyone may ask a public agency for copies of records requests made by others.\n</p>\n<p>\nNevertheless, recognizing the needs of those in the community who use\npublic records requests for research purposes, the site has chosen to permit an\nembargo period for up to 1 year. Most record requests in Hawaii are\nresolved within that period even allowing time for the requester to review the\nrecords before public release.\n</p>\n</li>\n<h3>Making a Request - To Which Agency</h3>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"8\"></a>I cannot find the public agency I want.</p>\n<p>\nThe site is not a comprehensive listing of all sub-units of government entities subject to\nHawaii’s public records law. Consider whether there is a more general agency responsible for\nthe entity you are seeking. For example, if you plan to request records from the State Fire\nCouncil, the appropriate contact agency is the State Department of Labor &amp; Industrial\nRelations. We have sought to make this information searchable, but not every entity may be\ncovered. If you have additional suggested search terms for particular agencies, please <a\nhref=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org?\nsubject=UIPA.org:%20Suggested%20Agency%20Search%20Terms\">let us know</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you find that we have missed an agency completely, please <a href=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org?\nsubject=UIPA.org:%20Missing%20Agency\">send us the information</a>.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"10\"></a>Can I request federal records from this site?</p>\n<p>\nNo, this site is tailored to state and county agencies subject to Hawaii’s public\nrecords law. Federal agencies are subject to the federal Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA). There are other sites that provide services tailored to\nFOIA. Consider using <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com\">MuckRock</a>.\n</p>\n</li>\n<h3>Making a Request - What to Ask For</h3>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"10.5\"></a>Why is there an ALL CAPS sentence in the middle of the request\nbox?</p>\n<p>\nThe system uses that sentence to distinguish between a request and a public interest\nstatement. Any text above the ALL CAPS sentence will be treated as part of the request for\nrecords. Any text below the sentence will be treated as part of a <a href=\"#26\">public interest\nstatement</a> for purposes of seeking a reduction in fees. The sentence will not appear in your\nactual request to the agency. We do not recommend deleting or making any changes to the ALL\nCAPS sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\nIf you delete or modify the sentence, the request will be sent to the agency as it appears in\nthe request box. For a public interest requester, that will cause two complications. First, the\nOIP form sent to the agency will not check the box identifying the requester as seeking a\nreduction in fees. Second, the request as posted on the public website will include the\nrequester's public interest statement; in the ordinary course, the platform does not typically\ninclude public interest statements in the information publicly posted on the website.</p>\n<p>\nIf you delete or modify the ALL CAPS sentence, you will be warned before the request is\nsubmitted. We recommend that public interest requesters cancel submission when warned and\nrestart the request process.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"11\"></a>Why would I make a request\nwithout referencing any personal information?\n</p>\n<p>\nIndividuals have a privacy interest in records about themselves. Whenever a\nrequest is made for records about a person, that person's privacy interest must be weighed\nagainst the public’s interest in releasing the record. A public agency may\nredact portions of a record to ensure that “private” information about the individual is\nnot disclosed to the general public. And in rare instances, the agency may be\nauthorized to say that it cannot confirm or deny even the existence of such\n\nrecords about a specific person. E.g., <a href=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/1995/08/95-21.pdf\">OIP Op. 95-21</a> at 18.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, if you make a request without identifying that person by name or any other\npersonal identifier, the public agency may maintain his or her privacy by redacting\nany personal identifying information from the document. In other words, the\ncontent of the record would be accessible, but there would be no information\ntying the content to a specific person. Making the request without the person's name thus\nwould result in more disclosure about government operations than a request\nusing a name.\n</p>\n<p>At a minimum, if you cannot avoid referencing an individual by name or personal identifier,\nconsider asking for the record both by name and by incident or other more generic description.\n\nSee, e.g., <a href=\"https://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/1998/11/98-05-Donohue-re-HPD-\nRequest-for-Opinion-on-The-Honolulu-Advertiser-Request-for-Internal-Affairs-Reports..pdf\">OIP\n\nOp. 98-5</a> at 26-27.\n<p>\n<b>You should not use the site to make personal records requests (a request for documents\nabout yourself).</b> When responding to a personal records requests, agencies provide\ndocuments without redacting your personal identifying or private information. Ultimately, that is\na problem because all\ninformation requested through the site is posted for public view. Your private information\nthus would be publicly disclosed if you used this site to make a personal records request.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"12\"></a>Isn’t it better to ask for “all” records about a topic?</p>\n<p>\nIn general, no, it is better to make as targeted a request as possible for\n\nrecords that you need. Requests for “any” or “all” records on a topic may\nresult in far more records than you need. The more records responsive to\nyour request, the public agency must spend more time reviewing and\nprocessing those records for disclosure. In addition to copying costs (if\napplicable), the public agency may charge you fees for searching, reviewing,\nand redacting records. For a voluminous set of responsive records, you can\nanticipate that the fees may be significant. Focusing your request typically\nreduces the cost of obtaining public records.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"13\"></a>\nCan I ask for records in native electronic formats?\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, “the agency must generally provide a copy of that government record in\nthe format requested by the public, unless doing so might significantly risk\n\ndamage, loss, or destruction of the original record.” E.g., <a href=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2001/09/01-03-Itomura-re-Disclosure-of-Directory-and-Other-Information-\nRegarding-Inmates.pdf\">OIP Op. 01-03</a> at 9-10 (database of inmate data must be disclosed\n\nin requested format). A public\nagency is not required, however, to convert electronic files to a format that is\nnot readily available. <i>Be sure to specify in your request the format you are\nseeking.</i> Also, be aware that the UIPA exceptions continue to apply, and\ncertain information may be redacted from electronic documents.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"14\"></a>\nCan I attach documents to my request?\n</p>\n<p>\nNo, the site does not support user-uploaded attachments. Keep in mind that public records\nrequests should be concise\ndescriptions of the documents sought. In most instances, attaching\ndocuments may provide more confusion than clarity for the public\nagency.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"15\"></a>\nDo I need to fill out a form?\n</p>\n<p>\nNo. The site processes your request to generate an email with attached <a\n\nhref=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Request-Access-form-\n12.1.151.pdf\">form</a>. The only information required to\n\nprocess a formal request for public records is: (1) a written, electronic, or\nother physical form of request (i.e., not a verbal request); (2) sufficient contact\ninformation to correspond with the requester; (3) a reasonable description of\nthe requested records; and (4) an express statement asking to inspect or\n\nobtain a copy of the requested records. <a\nhref=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/OIP%20Admin%20Rules.PDF\">HAR § 2-71-12</a>. However,\nsome public agencies have insisted that requesters fill out the form with each request, even\nthough it states at the top: “the Requester is not required to use this\nform or to provide any personal information.” To avoid any issues, the site has been\ndesigned to prepare the form automatically based on the information that you provide.\n</p>\n</li>\n<h3>Pending Requests</h3>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"16\"></a>Do I need to redact the documents on the request summary page?\n</p>\n<p>Any attachments on the request summary page may be redacted using the site's online\nredaction tool or may be printed, manually redacted, and uploaded to the site using the Got\nMail? button. Publishing individual documents will not reveal a request that otherwise is marked\nas non-public. If there is nothing to redact from the listed documents, you can simply choose to\nPublish This Attachment.</p>\n<p>The online redaction tool only works for PDF documents.</p>\n<p>Also, the online redaction tool does not handle some PDF files well. If you encounter any\nissues attempting to redact documents using the online tool, you can either (1) print, manually\nredact, and upload the document to the site using the Got Mail? button, or (2) <a\nhref=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org?subject=UIPA.org:%20Document%20for%20Upload\">send the\ndocument to us</a> (redacted or with notes about necessary redactions) for upload to the site.\nIf you send us the document, be sure to let us know what request it concerns.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"17\"></a>Why am I receiving email reminders about my request?</p>\n<p>\nYou will receive notifications when you send a request, when an agency sends a message\nresponding to your request, and when you send follow-up messages to the agency. In addition,\nif the public agency does not send any response to your request within 17 days, the site will\nnotify you that the request is overdue. The site also will send you weekly reminders if you have\nreceived a response from the agency, but have not classified the request as ongoing or\ncompleted. And if there has been no activity on an unresolved request for 6 months, you will\nreceive a reminder. Finally, for any request marked non-public, you will receive a reminder 2\nweeks before the request and any responses are publicly disclosed (1 year after the request).\n</p>\n<p>Because the request process can take weeks or months to\nresolve, reminders are critical to ensuring that you do not lose track of a\nrequest. If you receive a reminder, consider whether: (1) the request can be\nmarked as completed; or (2) you need to request a status update from the\npublic agency. Most importantly, when you receive a reminder, consider\nwhether you need to answer a response from the agency. Your request may\nbe considered abandoned (i.e., you will need to start the process over), if you\ntake more than 20 business days to pay an assessment of fees, make\narrangements to inspect records, or provide clarification when requested by\nthe agency. <a href=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/OIP%20Admin%20Rules.PDF\">HAR § 2-71-\n16</a>.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"18\"></a>The public agency has not responded to my request.</p>\n<p>\n\nFirst, confirm that the deadline for the agency’s response has passed. You\nshould receive some form of response no later than 10 business days after\nthe public agency receives your request. The type of response depends on\nyour request and the work required for the agency to respond. For more\ninformation on agency deadlines, the Public First Law Center has a <a\n\nhref=\"https://ln4.sync.com/dl/95de70bc0/4c9pv7mj-urakkyvp-c2x596he-\nza9iwrk6/view/doc/10259145850004\" target=\"_blank\">tipsheet</a>.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nSecond, if the deadline has passed, politely follow up with the public agency using the Send\na Message button on your request summary page. The Public First Law Center has a <a\n\nhref=\"https://ln4.sync.com/dl/69b49ac60/u2dxi87h-f9ssk47u-n2h7jr7e-\nfwiyzktu/view/doc/10259145940004\" target=\"_blank\">tipsheet</a> with possible language.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nThird, if you do not receive a response after follow-up, consider requesting\nassistance from the Office of Information Practices. To request assistance,\nemail <a href=\"mailto:oip@hawaii.gov\">oip@hawaii.gov</a>, attaching your prior e-mails to\nthe agency and OIP’s\n<a href=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/request_for_assistance_to_oip.pdf\">Form for Request for\nAssistance</a> (check that request was “Not answered” and\nthat you are seeking “Assistance in obtaining access to the requested\nrecord(s)”).\n</p>\n<p>Lastly, if your efforts are not successful, consult with an attorney.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"19\"></a>The public agency did not respond using the UIPA.org email address.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the public agency responded with a mailed hard copy or sent a message to your personal\nemail address, please scan the correspondence as a PDF and upload it to the site using the Got\nMail? button on the summary page for your request. If you need to redact personal information,\nyou can redact the document before you scan it or may use the online redaction tool once the\ndocument is uploaded. For example, you may wish to redact your personal email address or\npostal address from correspondence before that correspondence is published on the website.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"20\"></a>How do I send a message to the public agency about my request?\n</p>\n<p>If you want to send a follow-up message to a public agency, all correspondence should\ntake place through the UIPA.org platform. To send a follow-up message, use the Send A\nMessage button on the request's summary page.</p>\n</li>\n<h3>Denial of Requests</h3>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"21\"></a>Can a public agency deny my request?</p>\n<p>\nYes, even if you follow all the correct procedures in making a request, an\nagency may deny the request if you ask for records protected from disclosure\nunder the UIPA. There are five general exception categories under the UIPA:\n(1) personal privacy; (2) litigation privileges; (3) frustration of government\n\nfunction; (4) confidentiality statutes; and (5) legislative working papers. <a\n\nhref=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/laws-rules-opinions/uipa/uniform-information-practices-act-\nuipa/#92F13\" target=\"_blank\">HRS\n\n§ 92F-13</a>. The exceptions largely are discretionary, however, because the UIPA\n“generally, does not prohibit disclosure of\nrecords and information but rather authorizes government agencies to\nwithhold access to records and information in certain circumstances. Thus,\nagencies are not required to invoke the exceptions to access and may elect to\ndisclose records that could be withheld under the exceptions.” <a\n\nhref=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/04-12-Devick-re-Disclosure-of-Intra-\nOffice-E-mail-Messages.pdf\">OIP Op. 04-12</a> at 2 fn. 3.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n(1) Personal privacy. This exception protects from disclosure medical,\npersonnel, financial, and similar private information about an individual.\nPublic agencies must weigh the privacy interests of the individual against the\npublic interest in learning more about government operations to determine\nwhether particular information will be disclosed. In appropriate\ncircumstances, agencies may publicly disclose a document with names and\nother personal identifying information redacted to protect personal privacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n(2) Litigation privileges. The UIPA does not require public disclosure of\ninformation that the government could withhold from discovery in litigation.\nExamples of this protection include information protected by the attorney-client privilege and\ntrade\nsecrets.\n</p>\n<p>\n(3) Frustration exception. Although “frustration” is vague, the Legislature\nprovided examples of records that would fall within this exception. The\nLegislature’s list of examples is not comprehensive, but an agency seeking to\nadd a new category to this exception must have a strong justification. <a\nhref=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/1991/09/91-15.pdf\">OIP\nOp. 91-15</a> at 11-12 (“[W]e are constrained to construe the UIPA’s ‘frustration\nof legitimate government function’ exception narrowly, and extend its\napplication only upon a clear showing that the disclosure of a particular\ngovernment record would frustrate or impair a legitimate government\nfunction.”). For each of the following examples, there are more complex\nstandards that govern whether information must be disclosed.\n</p>\n<p>\nExamples of frustration:\n</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain law enforcement records</li>\n<li>Examination materials</li>\n<li>Certain government purchasing information</li>\n<li>Land acquisition information</li>\n<li>Security information</li>\n<li>Proprietary information</li>\n<li>Confidential business information</li>\n<li>Restricted access to donated records</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n(4) Confidentiality statutes. This exception protects from disclosure any\nrecords that a public agency is required to keep confidential by federal or\nstate law or by a court order. In other words, the UIPA does not require an\nagency to violate another law that expressly prohibits disclosure of\ninformation.\n</p>\n<p>\n(5) Legislative working papers. This exceptions protects legislative working\npapers and personal files of individual legislators.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"22\"></a>What are my options when a request is denied?</p>\n<p>\nWhen a public agency denies access to records, a requester has two options:\n(1) appeal the denial to the Office of Information Practices (within 1 year of\nthe denial); or (2) take the matter to state court (within 2 years of the denial).\nYou should consult with an attorney regarding your particular request.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"23\"></a>The agency refused to provide records in native electronic format.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are entitled to an explanation for why the public agency did not provide\nthe record in the format you requested. “[T]he agency must generally provide\na copy of that government record in the format requested by the public,\nunless doing so might significantly risk damage, loss, or destruction of the\noriginal record.” E.g., <a href=\"http://oip.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/01-03-\nItomura-re-Disclosure-of-Directory-and-Other-Information-Regarding-Inmates.pdf\">OIP Op. 01-\n03</a> at 9-10 (database of inmate data must be disclosed in requested format). There may be\nrare instances in which the\npublic agency has substantiated concerns that disclosure in native electronic\nformat would reveal metadata or other information that: (1) the agency\ncannot redact from the electronic record; and (2) is protected from disclosure\nby a UIPA exception.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"24\"></a>Is a public agency allowed to blackout portions of records?</p>\n<p>\nYes, an agency may redact (or segregate) information from publicly disclosed\nrecords to withhold specific information that is protected by a UIPA exception.\nRedacting records is preferable to the agency withholding the entire\ndocument simply because a few lines are protected by an exception. If you\ndisagree with the agency that the redacted information is protected by an\nexception, you can treat redactions as similar to denial of access for purposes\nof <a href=\"#22\">seeking further remedies</a>.\n</p>\n</li>\n<h3>Costs for Records</h3>\n<li>\n\n<p><a name=\"25\"></a>\nWhy am I being charged for access to public records?\n</p>\n<p>\nPublic agencies are permitted to charge certain fees and costs in responding\nto public records requests. Fees for searching for, reviewing, and redacting\nrecords are set by State regulation. <a\nhref=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/OIP%20Admin%20Rules.PDF\">HAR § 2-71-31</a>. All\nrequesters receive an\nautomatic discount intended to cover small requests; requests that serve the\npublic interest receive a slightly larger discount. <a\nhref=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/OIP%20Admin%20Rules.PDF\">HAR § 2-71-32</a>. Public\nagencies also may charge copying costs and other lawful costs incurred in\nproviding records.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"26\"></a>But records are free for reporters and public interest organizations,\nright?</p>\n<p>\nNo, but reporters and others making requests that serve the public interest should include in\nthe text of their requests a public interest\nstatement. The statement must: (1) state your identity; (2) explain how the\nrequested records concern government operations; (3) state that the records\nare not readily available to the public through other sources; and (4) explain\nhow you plan to widely disseminate the information in the records to the\ngeneral public. <a href=\"http://files.hawaii.gov/oip/OIP%20Admin%20Rules.PDF\">HAR § 2-\n71-32</a>. For detailed suggestions on language, the Public First Law Center has a <a\n\nhref=\"https://ln4.sync.com/dl/705c1d430/deukxju2-edx6fjih-49brfjmk-\nuy322i92/view/doc/10259145740004\" target=\"_blank\">tipsheet</a>.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Do not attempt to claim that dissemination on this site qualifies as wide\ndissemination to the general public.</i> The site will not provide information or\notherwise support such a claim.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a name=\"27\"></a>I am being charged copy costs for an electronic record.</p>\n<p>\nThere are a few reasons that this may occur. First, if the agency only had a\nhard copy of the document, it may be justified in charging the costs of\nscanning the record as a PDF. See <a\nhref=\"http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol02_Ch0046-0115/HRS0092/HRS_0092-\n0021.htm\" target=\"_blank\">HRS § 92-21</a>. Second, if the agency was\nrequired to printout an existing PDF for redactions, it may be justified in\ncharging the cost of the printout. Third, the agency may not have considered\nthat its standard copying charges are inappropriate when simply forwarding an\nelectronic record because the agency has not incurred the same labor,\nmaterials, and equipment costs for the electronic copy as would have when providing a\npaper copy. If there are no hard copy redactions to a requested\nrecord in electronic format, you would be justified in asking the public agency\nwhat basis it had for charging you copying costs.\n</p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>",

This Log Data may include information such as your IP\naddress, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet\nfrom an Internet service provider, the IP address may change from time to time, but please be aware that\nyour Internet service provider determines your IP address, including whether and how often it changes.\nPFLC uses Log Data to monitor use of the Website and the Service and for the technical administration of\nthe Website and the Service.</p>\n<h4>From Service Users</h4>\n<p>PFLC collects the same information from Service Users that PFLC collects from individuals who\nmerely browse the Website.</p>\n<p>You must create an Account in order to use the Service for the Purpose. We collect the contact\ninformation you have submitted in the creation of your Account, and use it to provide the Service to you.\nSubmissions may also be searchable by your user information, if you have enabled that function in your\nAccount settings.</p>\n<p>If you submit a Submission using the Service, you may request that we not publish the Submission for\na period of time. If we agree to an embargo period, during the embargo period for which we agree not to\npublish the Submission, as indicated in the Service, the Submission will not be publicly searchable, nor will\nwe publish the Submission. <strong>Unless you request that we not publish the Submission immediately,\nand in all cases at the expiration of the embargo period, we will publish the Submission through the\nService.</strong></p>\n<h3>How we use your information</h3>\n<p>While most of the information we collect (independent of the information you may make visible to us\nand others <em>within</em> the Service or in Submissions you draft and submit using the Service, or\nvoluntarily communicate to us by email or otherwise) is used internally for site analysis and improvement,\nwe may use some of the demographic information in registration data and Service usage data in compiling\nreports that we may disclose to our partners or the public. We also collect and utilize general usage\ninformation regarding your use of the Service. However, it is important to note that, except as stated in\nthis Privacy Policy, PFLC will never disclose or associate with your site usage any of your personally\nidentifiable information.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:\n<ol>\n<li>To deliver the Service and send notices and requests related to the Service and your account. This\nincludes submitting your Submissions, providing status update notifications regarding your Submission,\nproviding administrative notices, providing technical and user support, and soliciting your feedback.</li>\n\n<li>To inform you about the Service, such as letting you know about upcoming Service outages, changes\nor improvements or additional services we provide.</li>\n<li>To improve the Service and your experience within the Service (we continually strive to improve our\nofferings based on the information and feedback we receive).</li>\n<li>We may collect usage information regarding your use of the Service, both on an individual basis and in\nthe aggregate, and otherwise to collect, create and analyze metadata about the use of the Service in order\nto improve the Service and determine possible features to be offered, but we will not disclose to any third\nparty any usage information when associated with your personally identifiable information except as set\nforth in this Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How we protect your information</h3>\n<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of personally identifiable\ninformation when a user enters, submits, or accesses their personal information.</p>\n<p>We offer the use of a secure server for the Service. All personally identifiable information supplied by\nyou to us via the Service is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or similarly secure technology. We\nallow non-public personally identifiable information to be accessed only by persons with specified rights to\ndo so.</p>\n<p>Due to the open nature of communication through the Internet, we cannot guarantee that\ncommunications between you and the Service, or between you and us directly, will be free from\nunauthorized access by third parties, nor that third parties will not be able to circumvent the safeguards we\nhave put in place. Users of the Service do so at their own risk. We cannot absolutely guarantee the\nsecurity of any information that is disclosed or transmitted online.</p>\n<h3>Cookies</h3>\n<p>PFLC does use cookies. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to a\ncomputer hard drive through a Web browser (if the user allows the browser to do so) that enables the sites\nor service provider’s systems to recognize the browser and capture and remember certain information.\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data\nabout site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We\nmay contract with third-party service providers who use cookies to assist us in better understanding our\nsite visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf\nexcept to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>\n<p>If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer provide a warning each time a cookie is being\nsent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via their browser settings. If you turn cookies off, some\nelements of the Service, like most websites, may not function properly. </p>\n<p>We may also use tracking pixels in our emails to collect and use information that helps us provide our\nServices to you. Tracking pixels are small graphic images in email messages to determine whether the\nmessages were opened and the links were clicked. If you choose not to receive tracking pixels, you will\nneed to disable HTML images in your email program, but that may affect images in other emails you\nreceive.</p>\n<p>PFLC may also use analytics technologies such as Google Analytics. (For Google’s privacy practices\nsee <a\nhref=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html\">www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>\nand to opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics on the Service, see <a\nhref=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.)</p>\n<h3>Disclosure of information to outside parties</h3>\n<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information to outside parties except\nas expressly stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information (including as associated with usage information) to\ntrusted third party vendors working for us in connection with the operation of our Service and our business,\nso long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. Due to our contractual obligations\nwith these third parties and the need to share personally identifiable information to deliver and support the\nService, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing personally identifiable\ninformation with these third parties. PFLC does not store credit card or other payment information. </p>\n<p>As stated above, Users who submit Submissions must be aware that contact information is required to\nbe included in those Submissions, and that contact information <em>will be published</em>.</p>\n<p>We may also release personally identifiable information and associated usage information when we\nbelieve release is appropriate in order to respond to a law enforcement agency request, subpoena, court\norder or other such request by a legal authority, or to otherwise establish or exercise our rights, or defend\n\nagainst legal claims, to investigate, prevent and take action regarding fraud or misuse of the Service, to\ncomply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our own or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>\n<p>Personally identifiable information, including associated usage information, may be provided to a third\nparty if there is a transfer of the assets or ownership of PFLC or if PFLC files for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Finally, we emphasize again that any information that you may reveal in Submissions or in\ncommunication with other users is intentionally visible to other persons and is not in any way private. You\nshould think carefully before using the Service for the Purpose or otherwise publicly disclosing any\npersonally identifiable information. Anything you make public may be seen and/or collected by third\nparties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.</p>\n<h3>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>\n<p>We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act).

Our Service is directed to\npeople who are at least 13 years old or older.</p>\n<h3>PFLC Open Records Request Platform Privacy Policy Only</h3>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Service and not to information\ncollected offline or through other services or avenues, or to information we do not deliberately collect or\nneed for the provision of our Service, but which you may independently volunteer to send us, whether\nonline or offline.</p>\n<h3>Third Party Websites</h3>\n<p>The Service may contain links to web sites operated by third parties. PFLC is not responsible for the\nprivacy policies of any of these sites. Different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal\ninformation may apply. We strongly suggest you review any third party's privacy policies, before providing\nany data to those third parties.</p>\n<h3>Reasonable Efforts</h3>\n<p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and to take prompt corrective action\nwhen we learn of any failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our\nproducts and services, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these\nproducts and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue,\ndespite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns. In light of the above\nand because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, and the\nsecurity risks associated with using the Internet, we do not guarantee error-free performance under this\nPrivacy Policy. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, PFLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>\n<h3>Updating or Removing Your Information</h3>\n<p>You may choose to correct, update, or delete the information you have submitted to us in your Account\nsettings or by sending an email requesting changes to <a\nhref=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org\">admin@uipa.org</a>. However, please understand that deleted or\nobsolete information may continue to persist on backup media, and your Submissions (including any\npersonal information in such record requests and/or your name if associated with such record requests)\nwill not be deleted once you have submitted them through the Service.</p>\n<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If you have established an account for\nthe Service, we will attempt to inform you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that affect your\nobligations to us or our obligations to you: (a) by a message displayed at the time you log into the Service,\nand / or (b) by such other means as we deem reasonably likely to reach you. If you do not agree with any\nsuch modifications, the sole remedy is the termination of your Account, which in each case may be\nrequested through your Account settings, or if that option fails to accomplish the termination of your\naccount, by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:admin@uipa.org\">admin@uipa.org</a>. Your continued\nuse of the Service after receiving notice of any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified\nPrivacy Policy. </p>\n<p>If you have not established an account for the Service, any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be\neffective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the\nService, and your continued use of the Service after any modifications indicates acceptance of the\nmodified Privacy Policy.
