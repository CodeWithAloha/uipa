Code for Hawaii is an\r\n      organization of volunteers interested in open data, open knowledge, civic\r\n      apps, big data, data visualization, APIs and the application of technology\r\n      to make our communities better. In creating this site, we worked with the\r\n      Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest, a nonprofit organization\r\n      that advocates for open government in Hawaii.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I am a reporter and want to keep my request confidential until I have a\r\n      chance to review the materials disclosed. Can the site accommodate an\r\n      embargo?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Yes, you control whether a request and government response are published\r\n      for __ months after the request. When making the request, uncheck the box\r\n      stating \u201cThis request is public.\u201d If you already made a request and forgot to\r\n      uncheck the box, _________________.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When you are ready to publish the request and response, _______________.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      __ months after the request, it and any response will be published\r\n      regardless whether flagged as private.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Who has access to my requests while they are marked private or confidential?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      ___________ [Site Admin maybe for troubleshooting technical issues, not\r\n      Civil Beat Law Center].\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I want to keep my record request confidential forever. Why does the site\r\n      insist that requests become public after __ months?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      The process for obtaining public records can be difficult. But it is made\r\n      more difficult by the fact that individual members of the public cannot\r\n      build on the experiences of others going through the same struggle. By\r\n      sharing records and agency responses, the public benefits from the\r\n      collective experiences of other requesters.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Also your request for public records is not confidential because records\r\n      requests are not protected from disclosure under the UIPA. OIP Op. 93-23 at\r\n      5. Anyone may ask a public agency for copies of records requests made by\r\n      others.      \r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Nevertheless, recognizing the needs of those in the community who use\r\n      public records requests for research purposes, the site chose to permit an\r\n      embargo period for up to __ months. Most record requests in Hawaii are\r\n      resolved within that period even allowing time for the requester to review the\r\n      records before public release.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I cannot find the public agency I want. Where is it?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The site is not comprehensive listing of all organizations subject to Hawaii\u2019s\r\n      public records law. Consider whether there is a more general agency\r\n      responsible for the entity you are seeking. For example, if you plan to request\r\n      records from the State Fire Council, the appropriate contact agency is the\r\n      State Department of Labor &amp; Industrial Relations. We have sought to make\r\n      this information searchable, but not every entity may be covered. If you have\r\n      additional suggested search terms for particular agencies, please let us know.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I found the right public agency, but it does not have an email address. Can I\r\n      still make a request from this site?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      _____________ [process for suggesting generic email addresses to add].\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I want records from a federal agency. Can I make that request from this site?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      No, this site is tailored to state and county agencies subject to Hawaii\u2019s public\r\n      records law. Federal agencies are subject to the federal Freedom of\r\n      Information Act (FOIA). There are other sites that provide services tailored to\r\n      FOIA. Consider using iFOIA or FOIA Machine.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I want to attach documents to my request. Can I still make a request from\r\n      this site?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      _____________ [feasible?]. Public records requests should be concise\r\n      descriptions of the documents sought. In most instances, attaching\r\n      documents may provide more confusion than clarity for the responding public\r\n      agency.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I would like to request electronic files (e.g., native electronic formats). Are\r\n      such records subject to the public records law?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Yes, \u201cthe agency must generally provide a copy of that government record in\r\n      the format requested by the public, unless doing so might significantly risk\r\n      damage, loss, or destruction of the original record.\u201d \u00a0E.g., OIP Op. 01-03 at 9-\r\n      10 (database of inmate data must be disclosed in requested format). A public\r\n      agency is not required, however, to convert electronic files to a format that is\r\n      not readily available. Be sure to specify in your request the format you are\r\n      seeking. Also, be aware that the UIPA exceptions continue to apply, and\r\n      certain information may be redacted from electronic documents.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I want a report about John Doe (or myself). Why would I make a request\r\n      without referencing any personal information?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      John Doe has a privacy interest in any records about himself. Whenever a\r\n      request is made for such records, Doe\u2019s privacy interest must be weighed\r\n      against the public\u2019s interest in releasing the record. A public agency may\r\n      redact portions of a record to ensure that \u201cprivate\u201d information about Doe is\r\n      not disclosed to the general public. And in rare instances, the agency may be\r\n      authorized to say that it cannot confirm or deny even the existence of such\r\n      records about Doe. E.g., OIP Op. 95-21 at 18.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      However, if you make a request without identifying Doe by name or any other\r\n      personal identifier, the public agency may maintain Doe\u2019s privacy by redacting\r\n      Doe\u2019s personal identifying information from the document. In other words, the\r\n      content of the record would be accessible, but there would be no information\r\n      tying the content to John Doe. Making the request without Doe\u2019s name thus\r\n      would result in more disclosure about government operations than a request\r\n      using his name.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      You should not use the site to make personal records requests. All\r\n      information requested through the site ultimately is posted for public review.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Isn\u2019t it better to ask for \u201call\u201d records about a topic?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      In general, no, it is better to make as targeted a request as possible for\r\n      records that you need. Requests for \u201cany\u201d or \u201call\u201d records on a topic may\r\n      result in far more records than you need. The more records responsive to\r\n      your request, the public agency must spend more time reviewing and\r\n      processing those records for disclosure. In addition to copying costs (if\r\n      applicable), the public agency may charge you fees for searching, reviewing,\r\n      and redacting records. For a voluminous set of responsive records, you can\r\n      anticipate that the fees may be significant. Focusing your request typically\r\n      reduces the cost of obtaining public records.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I am a reporter or public interest organization. Can I get records for free?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      No, but you should include in the text of your request a public interest waiver\r\n      statement. The statement must: (1) state your identity; (2) explain how the\r\n      requested records concern government operations; (3) state that the records\r\n      are not readily available to the public through other sources; and (4) explain\r\n      how you plan to widely disseminate the information in the records to the\r\n      general public. HAR \u00a7\u00a027132. For detailed suggested language, the Civil\r\n      Beat Law Center has a tipsheet.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Do not attempt to claim that dissemination on this site qualifies as wide\r\n      dissemination to the general public. The site will not provide information or\r\n      otherwise support such a claim.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      My submitted request appears on the site when I login, but I did not receive a\r\n      copy by email and am not receiving email responses from the public agency.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Confirm that your email server is not blocking emails from [uipa.org]. You\r\n      may need to add [uipa.org] to a server whitelist. If you cannot add domains to\r\n      your server whitelist, you may wish to use a different email address for this\r\n      site. [FYI, Star Advertiser uses an aggressive mail server that requires each\r\n      new sender to verify his/her existence through an email back system. I am\r\n      assuming that would not work with the platform, and I have no idea whether\r\n      the SA reporters have the ability to add to their whitelist. With that in mind, I\r\n      defer to you on the best way to address that situation in this help or\r\n      otherwise.]\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The public agency will not accept my request unless I fill out some form. Am I\r\n      required to fill out this form?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      No, as stated at the top of the form, \u201cthe Requester is not required to use this\r\n      form or to provide any personal information.\u201d The only information required to\r\n      process a formal request for public records is: (1) a written, electronic, or\r\n      other physical form of request (i.e., not a verbal request); (2) sufficient contact\r\n      information to correspond with the requester; (3) a reasonable description of\r\n      the requested records; and (4) an express statement asking to inspect or\r\n      obtain a copy of the requested records. HAR \u00a7\u00a027112.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The public agency has not responded to my request. What do I do now?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      First, confirm that the deadline for the agency\u2019s response has passed. You\r\n      should receive some form of response no later than 10 business days after\r\n      the public agency receives your request. The type of response depends on\r\n      your request and the work required for the agency to respond. For more\r\n      information on agency deadlines, the Civil Beat Law Center has a tipsheet.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Second, if the deadline has passed, politely follow up with the public agency.\r\n      The Civil Beat Law Center has a tipsheet with possible language.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Third, if you do not receive a response after follow-up, consider requesting\r\n      assistance from the Office of Information Practices. To request assistance,\r\n      email oip@hawaii.gov, attaching your prior e-mails to the agency and OIP\u2019s\r\n      Form for Request for Assistance (check that request was \u201cNot answered\u201d and\r\n      that you are seeking \u201cAssistance in obtaining access to the requested\r\n      record(s)\u201d).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Lastly, if your efforts are not successful, consult with an attorney.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Why am I receiving email reminders about my request?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      The site will remind you monthly about each request until you mark it as\r\n      completed. Because the request process can take weeks or months to\r\n      resolve, reminders are critical to ensuring that you do not lose track of a\r\n      request. If you receive a reminder, consider whether: (1) the request can be\r\n      marked as completed; or (2) you need to request a status update from the\r\n      public agency. Most importantly, when you receive a reminder, consider\r\n      whether you need to answer a response from the agency. Your request may\r\n      be considered abandoned (i.e., you will need to start the process over), if you\r\n      take more than 20 business days to pay an assessment of fees, make\r\n      arrangements to inspect records, or provide clarification when requested by\r\n      the agency. HAR \u00a7\u00a027116.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I received a hard copy response from the public agency. What do I do with it?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Please scan and upload the response to the site. _________________\r\n      [instructions]\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Can a public agency deny my request?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Yes, even if you follow all the correct procedures in making a request, an\r\n      agency may deny the request if you ask for records protected from disclosure\r\n      under the UIPA. There are five general exception categories under the UIPA:\r\n      (1) personal privacy; (2) litigation privileges; (3) frustration of government\r\n      function; (4) confidentiality statutes; and (5) legislative working papers. HRS\r\n      \u00a7\u00a092F13. The UIPA, however, \u201cgenerally, does not prohibit disclosure of\r\n      records and information but rather authorizes government agencies to\r\n      withhold access to records and information in certain circumstances. Thus,\r\n      agencies are not required to invoke the exceptions to access and may elect to\r\n      disclose records that could be withheld under the exceptions.\u201d OIP Op. 04-12\r\n      at 2 n.3.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      (1) Personal privacy. This exception protects from disclosure medical,\r\n      personnel, financial, and similar private information about an individual.\r\n      Public agencies must weigh the privacy interests of the individual against the\r\n      public interest in learning more about government operations to determine\r\n      whether particular information will be disclosed. In appropriate\r\n      circumstances, agencies may publicly disclose a document with names and\r\n      other personal identifying information redacted to protect personal privacy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      (2) Litigation privileges. The UIPA does not require public disclosure of\r\n      information that the government could withhold from discovery in litigation.\r\n      Examples of this protection include information protected by the attorney-\r\n      client privilege, psychologist-client privilege, spousal privilege, and trade\r\n      secrets.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      (3) Frustration exception. Although \u201cfrustration\u201d is vague, the Legislature\r\n      provided examples of records that would fall within this exception. The\r\n      Legislature\u2019s list of examples is not comprehensive, but an agency seeking to\r\n      add a new category to this exception must have a strong justification. OIP\r\n      Op. 91-15 at 11-12 (\u201c[W]e are constrained to construe the UIPA\u2019s \u2018frustration\r\n      of legitimate government function\u2019 exception narrowly, and extend its\r\n      application only upon a clear showing that the disclosure of a particular\r\n      government record would frustrate or impair a legitimate government\r\n      function.\u201d). For each of the following examples, there are more complex\r\n      standards that govern whether information must be disclosed.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Examples of frustration:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Certain law enforcement records</li>\r\n        <li>Examination materials</li>\r\n        <li>Certain government purchasing information</li>\r\n        <li>Land acquisition information</li>\r\n        <li>Security information</li>\r\n        <li>Proprietary information</li>\r\n        <li>Confidential business information</li>\r\n        <li>Restricted access to donated records</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      (4) Confidentiality statutes. This exception protects from disclosure any\r\n      records that a public agency is required to keep confidential by federal or\r\n      state law or by a court order. In other words, the UIPA does not require an\r\n      agency to violate another law that expressly prohibits disclosure of\r\n      information.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      (5) Legislative working papers. This exceptions protects legislative working\r\n      papers and personal files of individual legislators.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The public agency denied my request. What can I do?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When a public agency denies access to records, a requester has two options:\r\n      (1) appeal the denial to the Office of Information Practices (within 1 year of\r\n      the denial); or (2) take the matter to state court (within 2 years of the denial).\r\n      You should consult with an attorney regarding your particular request.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The public agency said it will be disclosing records, but wants to charge me.\r\n      Why am I being charged for access to public records?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Public agencies are permitted to charge certain fees and costs in responding\r\n      to public records requests. Fees for searching for, reviewing, and redacting\r\n      records are set by State regulation. HAR \u00a7\u00a027131. All requesters receive an\r\n      automatic discount intended to cover small requests; requests that serve the\r\n      public interest receive a slightly larger discount. HAR \u00a7\u00a027132. Public\r\n      agencies also may charge copying costs and other lawful costs incurred in\r\n      providing records.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Why is a public agency charging me copy costs for an electronic record?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      There are a few reasons that this may occur. First, if the agency only had a\r\n      hard copy of the document, it may be justified in charging the costs of\r\n      scanning the record as a PDF. See HRS \u00a7\u00a09221. Second, if the agency was\r\n      required to printout an existing PDF for redactions, it may be justified in\r\n      charging the cost of the printout. Third, the agency may not have considered\r\n      that its standard copying charges are inappropriate for forwarding an\r\n      electronic record because the agency has not incurred the same labor,\r\n      materials, and equipment costs for the electronic copy as would have been\r\n      required for a paper copy. If there are no hard copy redactions to a requested\r\n      record in electronic format, you would be justified in asking the public agency\r\n      what basis it had for charging you copying costs.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I asked for a spreadsheet in its original Excel format, but the public agency\r\n      sent me a PDF. Am I entitled to a copy in Excel format?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You are entitled to an explanation for why the public agency did not provide\r\n      the record in the format you requested. \u201c[T]he agency must generally provide\r\n      a copy of that government record in the format requested by the public,\r\n      unless doing so might significantly risk damage, loss, or destruction of the\r\n      original record.\u201d \u00a0E.g., OIP Op. 01-03 at 9-10 (database of inmate data must\r\n      be disclosed in requested format). There may be rare instances in which the\r\n      public agency has substantiated concerns that disclosure in native electronic\r\n      format would reveal metadata or other information that: (1) the agency\r\n      cannot redact from the electronic record; and (2) is protected from disclosure\r\n      by a UIPA exception.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The public agency blacked out portions of the records. Is that allowed?</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Yes, an agency may redact (or segregate) information from publicly disclosed\r\n      records to withhold specific information that is protected by a UIPA exception.\r\n      Redacting records is preferable to the agency withholding the entire\r\n      document simply because a few lines are protected by an exception. If you\r\n      disagree with the agency that the redacted information is protected by an\r\n      exception, you can treat redactions as similar to denial of access for purposes\r\n      of seeking further remedies.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>",
